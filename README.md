Introduction:
The project is about creating an end-to-end Information Retrieval chatbot that can intelligently
answer user queries using information from Wikipedia scraped documents. It can handle diverse
conversations across various topics like health, technology, travel etc. by integrating web
scraping, indexing and query handling It can also perform general conversations or casual talks..
To build this chatbot, we developed a web scraper that gathers and indexes a dataset of more than
60,000 documents and classifies the topics to give accurate query responses. In addition, the
chatbot includes strong exception handling to handle mistakes seamlessly and provide analytical
insights through visualizations based on the conversations in the user interface.

Methodology:
This architecture outlines the process of building a chatbot capable of handling both general
conversations (chit-chat) and answering questions using information from Wikipedia documents.
Each step in the system plays an essential role in ensuring the chatbot works smoothly and
accurately. Here's how it works
